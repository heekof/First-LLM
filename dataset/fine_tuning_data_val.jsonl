His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surgery"}]}

There was spontaneous echocardiogram contrast noticed.  The patient was on anticoagulation with Lovenox, received already 3 mg of Versed and 25 mcg of fentanyl for the TEE followed by next 2 mg of Versed for total of 5 mg of Versed.  The pads applied in the anterior and posterior approach.  With synchronized biphasic waveform at 150 J, one shock was successful in restoring sinus rhythm.  The patient had some occasional PACs noticed with occasional sinus tachycardia.  The patient had no immediate post-procedure complications.

The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb.  Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles.  The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.,The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained.

The patient's tolerance of previous anesthesia has been reviewed.  The risks and benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient.  All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained.  Mental Status Examination:  alert and oriented.  Airway Examination:  normal oropharyngeal airway and neck mobility.  Respiratory Examination:  clear to auscultation.  CV Examination:  RRR, no murmurs, no S3 or S4.  ASA Grade Assessment:  P1 A normal healthy patient.  After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure.  The anesthesia plan was to use conscious sedation.  Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives.  The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure.  The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure.  After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision.  Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously.

A zig-zag incision was made down the palmar surface of the little finger and under the palm up to the mid palm region.  Skin flaps were elevated carefully, dissecting Dupuytren contracture off the undersurface of the flaps.  Both neurovascular bundles were identified proximally in the hand and the Dupuytren disease fibrous band was divided proximally, which essentially returned to normal-appearing tissue.  The neurovascular bundles were then dissected distally resecting everything medial to the 2 neurovascular bundles and above the flexor tendon sheath all the way out to the PIP joint of the finger where the Dupuytren disease stopped.  The wound was irrigated.  The neurovascular bundles rechecked with no evidence of any injury and the neurovascular bundles were not significantly involved in the Dupuytren disease.
